# WTWR (What to Wear?): Front end
The front-end project for WTWR is focused on building the user interface for the application — the part users interact with in their browser. You'll create a responsive and interactive UI that allows users to log in, view and add clothing items, and see suggestions based on the weather.


The end goal is to create a functional, user-friendly interface that communicates with a backend API to display and manage clothing items, based on real-time weather data.


## Tools and Functions Used
This project helps you deepen your understanding of:

React and component-based design

Managing state and props

Making API calls to the backend server

Handling user authentication and session storage on the client side

Creating a smooth user experience with forms, modals, and conditional rendering

Applying styles using CSS or CSS-in-JS

## # WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Tech stack and tools

The stck used for this project include : 
~ MongoDB, as our database  
~ Postman, to test, debug, and document our API.

Switching over to the back-end side of our WTWR project a couplel diffrent tools where used to crate this back-end. Starting off with the set up of ESLint in the Airbnb style, allowing us to maintain clean, consistant, and easy to understand code. Using Mongoos as our priamry database collection for our items. The introduction of schemas an dpassign them properly to create the validation as well as error handleing . 


## Running the Project
