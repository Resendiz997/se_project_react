# WTWR (What to Wear?): Front end
The front-end project for WTWR is focused on building the user interface for the application â€” the part users interact with in their browser. You'll create a responsive and interactive UI that allows users to log in, view and add clothing items, and see suggestions based on the weather.


The end goal is to create a functional, user-friendly interface that communicates with a backend API to display and manage clothing items, based on real-time weather data.

React and component-based design

Managing state and props
