# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.
We make use of lattitude and longitude to access the users currenet weather in the their current location. Depending on the time of day or night the weather banner changes respectivly to the time based on where its located. The tempature will also coorilate as time changes. This project comes together as an interactive app that will give you real time recommended outfits that adapt to the weather based on your location. 

In the making of this project many diffrent components and methods were used to simplify the code. 
Methods such as :
- Proper file structure to simplify the break down of our app.
- Deconstruction to ease "unpacking" pieces of code.
- useState() hooks to reuse and store code for future refreence.
- Exersice fetch request for an interactive use. 
- The closing and opening of modals for specific parts of the app. 
- proper use of Promise in certain cards.
